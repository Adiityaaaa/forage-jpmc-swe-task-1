# clientTest.py

`clientTest.py` is a Python unit test file designed to test the `getDataPoint` function from the `client3.py` script. It uses the `unittest` framework to run tests and assertions on the function. Below is a brief description of the file and its usage.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the `client3.py` script is in the same directory as `clientTest.py` or update the import statement in `clientTest.py` to point to the correct location of `client3.py`.

2. Define test cases within the `ClientTest` class to test the `getDataPoint` function. These test cases should include various scenarios and expected outcomes.

3. Add assertions within the test cases to check whether the `getDataPoint` function behaves as expected.

4. Run the `clientTest.py` script to execute the defined unit tests and check the function's correctness.

## Important Notes

- The provided README assumes that you have already configured the `client3.py` script and its functions as intended. The focus of this README is on testing the `getDataPoint` function.

- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Python's `unittest` framework.

- Additional unit tests can be added to cover different scenarios and edge cases for the `getDataPoint` function.

**Disclaimer**: Unit tests aim to verify the correctness of code but may not cover all possible scenarios. Additional testing and validation may be required depending on the specific use case.

For any questions or issues related to testing or the `client3.py` script, please contact the script author or refer to relevant documentation.
